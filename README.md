This project is my study guide to Exams *AZ-300: Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies* and *AZ-301:	Microsoft Azure Architect Design*. Below is a Table of Contents that has links to all different parts of the Exam. Everything on the [official site for the exam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/azure-solutions-architect.aspx#skillsandknowledge) is found here verbatim. The detailed breakdown of the individual components are in the respective exam directories and are presented in an outline style with links to documentation on each Azure resource in the exams. Enjoy!


Inspired by a [similar repo for 70-535 exam](https://github.com/lwoodyiii/Azure-Exam-70-535) and [Pixel robots](https://pixelrobots.co.uk/2018/09/study-resources-for-the-az-300/) who have put up some additional links that I am consulting for reference.

STATUS: Links updated till first section of AZ-300!

For preparing AZ-300 and AZ-301, along with other new exams for role-based Azure certifications, you can follow the [e-learning provided directly by Mircosoft](https://cloudsociety.learning.microsoft.com/courses) and look for AZ* courses.
